This extension brings the beloved Spacemacs color scheme to Visual Studio Code, available in both light and dark variations. It aims to provide a comfortable and visually appealing coding experience for fans of the Spacemacs environment.

## Project Philosophy

Creating a VS Code theme is a complex task.

It's simple to make a theme that *works*, but creating one that is beautiful, reduces visual fatigue, and accounts for the thousands of TextMate scopes across hundreds of languages is a meticulous and demanding job.

The primary goal of this theme is to build upon the excellent Spacemacs color foundation to provide more friendly and intuitive coloring for markup languages. For example, use of distinct colors for different heading levels, making document structure easier to parse at a glance.
